Test website I made for a class project back when I was learning to use flask and sqlite3 in python. Now I'm just using as a personal template for future reference.


### Screenshots of features:

### Steps to get it to work:
- Download the files
- Pip install flask (if you don't have it already)
- Run *main.py*
- Open the website on local host (_http://127.0.0.1:81/_), and it should work



### Concepts it implements:
- Flask render_template and redirecting stuff
- Html buttons and boxes and stuff
- Basic jjinja syntax to display information
- Basic database manipulation to store and get data



(yes it's ugly, I was too lazy to implement css back then)
